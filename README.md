# Klasha Assessment

## Get started

`npm install` or `yarn`

## Run tests

`npm run test` or `yarn test`

## Notes

1. Dahsboard Graphs - There is a bug with the resize listener for the graphs, so there may be some laggy downsizing/responsiveness on the dashboard. Given time, this can be remedied with a custom ResponsiveContainer for each graph.
2. Unit Tests - Due to time constraints I only added a couple test suites, but it should give you an idea of how I'd apply them to the app.
