## Notes

1. _Dashboard Graphs_ - There is a bug with the resize listener for the graphs, so there may be some laggy downsizing/responsiveness on the dashboard. Given time, this can be remedied with a custom ResponsiveContainer for each graph.
2. _Unit Tests_ - Due to time constraints I only added a couple test suites, but it should give you an idea of how I'd apply them to the app.
